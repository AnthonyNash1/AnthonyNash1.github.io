<p>Due to the fact that typical structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, dripping roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to thrive. 8 This moisture vapor passes through ceilings and walls, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
