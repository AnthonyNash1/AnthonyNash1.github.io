<p>Flooding of a private sewer system can be a harmful situation for house owners, according to Plumbing 2.0's veteran pipes experts in Mesa, Arizona It might lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, infected drinking water and absence of sanitation until the system is repaired.

<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's going at the present rate, my next bill will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he discovered just how much water expense I was paying because the leak began, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the place & found of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Extremely polite and easy-going person.</p>
