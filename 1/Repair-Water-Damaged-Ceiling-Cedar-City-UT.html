<p>Because typical structure materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically related to water or wetness direct exposure and may be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold development.

Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
