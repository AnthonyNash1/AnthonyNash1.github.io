By decreasing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped joints under a number of coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is very important to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the job is ended up.<p>
