<p>Mold can trigger serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you might not know is that many chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really assists in mold growth. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>If a pipe in your home has dripped for months and gone without repair work, mold can grow as a result, however it won't be covered by your property owners insurance coverage. Since floods can likewise cause mold, any possible mold that grows as an outcome of a flood would be covered by flood insurance coverage, if you have it. Need to you submit a claim for mold damage, this cause would be evaluated and identified by the flood insurance adjuster.</p>

<p>HVAC: Heating unit and ac system systems can end up being flooded, which can damage their internal electrical systems and splash pilot lights.

<p>Fire is the result of a chemical reaction in between the oxygen that exists in the environment and a source of flammable fuel.

While smoke and the residue it leaves behind can trigger lasting damage and should be dealt with by knowledgeable experts, heat is the most visible, and devastating, product of this chain reaction.
