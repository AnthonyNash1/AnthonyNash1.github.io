<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his guys were fantastic in helping us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They were quick to get to your house and started drying our soaked crawlspace instantly. They came back every day (typically twice a day) to monitor and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the way and likewise were very useful in coordinating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the expenses and I 'd suggest them without hesitation.</p>
<p>Before the house has dried, scrub floorings and woodwork with a stiff brush, a lot of water, a detergent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by infected floodwater should be eliminated and disposed of unless it can be sterilized at an industrial center for a cost substantially less than replacement. Vinyl flooring and floor tile might require to be gotten rid of to enable drying of subfloor.</p>
