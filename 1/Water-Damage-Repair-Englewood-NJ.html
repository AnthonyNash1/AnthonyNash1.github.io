<p>Recent Evaluation: I needed an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was leaping up like crazy (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leakage began, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He marked the location & discovered of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Easy-going and very respectful person.</p>
