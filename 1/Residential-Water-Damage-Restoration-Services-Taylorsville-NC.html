<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Water damage, water intrusion, constructing envelope issues, and building and construction defects are a really serious matter. Here in Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington and the surrounding areas are experiencing many problems due to leaking doors and windows, water and wind driven rain damage. Senior living facilities, homes, condos, townhouses, hotels, industrial structures are specifically vulnerable to these issues as typically the builder subcontracts the outside envelope work and wall assembly process, therefore leading to expenses and corners being cut.</p>
