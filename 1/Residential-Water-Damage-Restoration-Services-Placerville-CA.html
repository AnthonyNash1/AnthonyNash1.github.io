Part of our monitoring process includes inspecting ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature too, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can likewise set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service specialists before you make any adjustments.</p>
