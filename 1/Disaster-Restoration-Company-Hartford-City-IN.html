As soon as MacBook water damage has actually taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other elements.

If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process.
