<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess wetness is at risk of mold development. Use a respirator or a facemask ranked for black mold spore protection, and cover hands, arms and legs to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to get rid of visible mold.

Next, use commercial black mold removal products, which can be found in the majority of hardware or home repair stores, to sanitize the moldy areas, in addition to any surrounding locations. If you use bleach, ensure it will not tarnish the product or surface area. Place all sponges, devices and other products used in cleaning in a sturdy trash can, and if possible, get rid of the bag through a close-by exit as opposed to the primary home, to prevent dispersing mold spores.</p>
