<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Grass Valley - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repair work. By reducing the density here, it's easier to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even.<p>
