<p>Eliminate it; take the SIM card out too if the wet iPhone is in a case. (Removing the battery would not injure either, but only if you're positive about the technicalities and do not mind voiding the warranty.) These steps assist to minimize the number of crannies and nooks where water can stick around, and prevent damage to parts. Next, scrub the area to eliminate all of the mold and mold discolorations. And lastly, wipe the surface area to remove residual mold and spores.<p>

We take pride in being a part of the Roanoke neighborhood and want to do our part in making it the very best it can be.

<p>Notification that your home is flooded? Don't lose time, and call a professional immediately. If you have no experience with the situation, a flooded home is not something that you can repair yourself. Call a water damage restoration company that can completely examine the extent of the damage, and can use the very best strategy. Do not even think of taking a hair clothes dryer to your handset. If there is any water on your phone's hardware, included heat could trigger corrosion. Instead, begin with a soft, microfiber cloth, the kind you utilize to clean spots off of your glasses. If you can eliminate the back panel of your phone, utilize a fabric to clean down the parts inside.<p>
