<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. Some property owners choose to repair smoke damage by themselves instead of employing an expert.

<p>Since common building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- pipes issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots moisture from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold development.</p>
