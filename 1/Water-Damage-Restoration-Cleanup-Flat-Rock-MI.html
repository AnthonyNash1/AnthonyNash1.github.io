Cooking area flare-ups, closed fireplace flues, and electrical fires can send smoke throughout your home, charring walls, covering whatever, and stinking up the location. The longer you let smoke and smells stick around, the more they soak into walls, carpets, and furnishings. So get to work, but not without gloves, eye defense, a facemask, and a respirator to keep smoke particles off your skin and out of your lungs.</p>

Never utilize soot cleaner or water before you use a dry-cleaning sponge, or you might spread the soot and make it impossible to eliminate with a chemical sponge. Start cleaning the walls gently with the dry-cleaning sponge. After a few strokes, turn the sponge to a different side so you're constantly utilizing a clean surface area. When all sides are soiled, slice off the sides with a knife to expose fresh surfaces underneath. Or simply get a brand-new sponge. Make sure you utilize a cleaning movement the whole time. You might spread them and work the soot deeper into the surface if you scrub the spots.</p>
