<p>The impacts of water damage happen with time, once you discover something different about your wood floors, water damage has currently set in. Oftentimes the very first sign there is a problem, and there is water damage, is when specific slabs are cupping or several start to crown causing a bulge in the floor. Water absorption in the wood of your floor triggers expansion, which is most visible in the edges of the board that are turning upward or when slabs begin to buckle.
