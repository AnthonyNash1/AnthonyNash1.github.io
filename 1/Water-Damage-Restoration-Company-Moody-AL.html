<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the property with air scrubbers. We frequently will set one unit for every two to three spaces, depending upon the size of the room. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it travels through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA performance, which means that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can picture, over the course of several days, the air that can be found in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
