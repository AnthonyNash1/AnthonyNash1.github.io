<p>The most significant component that can be eliminated is the moisture that mold requires to cultivate. There are over 100,000 kinds of species of mold, but the most common types of mold grow within 3-5 days. After a mold spore arrive at a food source that is moist and warm, it begins to germinate and colonize within 24-48 hours. Hyphae or roots start to grow into the food source and mycotoxins or poisonous gasses are released as the fungi spreads. Mold in your home can be very unsafe and lead to a range of health problems. If the mold in your house is not gotten rid of effectively it can continue to grow, making effective mold remediation more expensive and hard.<p>
