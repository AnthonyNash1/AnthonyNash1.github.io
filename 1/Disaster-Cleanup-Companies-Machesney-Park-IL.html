When MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other components.

This is due to the metals oxidizing and slowly wearing away. If there is a source of power readily available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will communicate with the liquid and accelerate this rust process.
