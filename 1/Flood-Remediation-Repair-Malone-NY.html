Delays or incomplete drying can mean extra damage and can result in higher expenses down the roadway. Getting your life back to normal quickly, with the job done right, is our highest top priority. Gray water damage is that in which the source of the water might contain chemicals or other pollutants that could cause discomfort or sickness to the residents.
