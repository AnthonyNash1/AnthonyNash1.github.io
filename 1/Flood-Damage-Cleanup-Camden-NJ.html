<p>Mold in the basement can be persistent, provided the nature of basements - they tend to be a lot more damp than above-ground levels and typically have poor ventilation and little air circulation, a mix that can cause mold to flourish.

Part of our tracking process consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the wet air.

These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA efficiency, which indicates that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned and much of the odor eliminated. This process goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of a number of days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing procedures.</p>
