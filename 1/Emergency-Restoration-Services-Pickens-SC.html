<h2>A Guide to Understanding Water Damage Restoration in Pickens</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that the majority of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will just eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>To prevent mold and practice sufficient cooking area upkeep, open windows to improve ventilation and run the hood vent when cooking and cleaning. Wipe water from difficult surface areas, and fix leaky faucets as soon as possible. Constantly make sure your tableware and serving meals are dry before keeping them to keep mold from proliferating in cabinets. Scrub mold from surfaces as soon as it appears, then make sure to dry the area to avoid it from spreading.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we want to address using bleach on mold. Using bleach on visible mold development is NOT recommended by either the EPA or the CDC and is not part of the ANSI-IICRC S520 Standard for Expert Mold Remediation. First, bleach is a chemical and can impact individuals with chemical sensitivities specifically if utilized in areas that are not well ventilated. Second, on non-porous surface areas such as tile, bleach is no more reliable at eliminating mold than a wet cloth and a mild detergent, so we suggest the least toxic choice.</p>
<p>Some air cleaners are developed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing representative and a recognized irritant of the lungs and breathing system. Research studies have revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is ineffective at killing air-borne mold or surface mold contamination. Even if mold was killed by ozone, the health dangers would not be reduced until mold impurities are eliminated through cleaning. Health experts, consisting of the Minnesota Department of Health, do not advise using ozone to resolve mold or any other indoor air problems.</p>
