<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, just as fire does. Many individuals believe that due to the fact that smoke increases into the air, diffusion takes place, and it simply goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread, harming a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be.

Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" detects wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
