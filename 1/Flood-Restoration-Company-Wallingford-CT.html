<p>A Wisconsin home in SE Wisconsin experienced a kitchen area fire when a grease fire began on the range. The owner utilized a fire extinguisher to put out the fire but after smoke and soot traveled throughout your home of this two-story home it was affected in different ways.

Water and sewage must be extracted, and the impacted locations professionally cleaned up, ventilated, dried and decontaminated as rapidly as possible to minimize germs, mold. and other hazardous microbe development, which can cause extra damage to the home on top of water damage and create potential health threats for your household or employees.<p>
<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperature levels to grow. Nutrients for mold exist in dead organic material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also derive nutrients from some synthetic products such as paints and adhesives. Mold requires moisture, although some mold types can acquire that wetness from moist air when the relative humidity is above 70 per cent. Carefully pry baseboards away from walls so that you can examine sheetrock at floor level. The porous product can rapidly absorb flood water, and you need to know the extent of potential damage.<p>
