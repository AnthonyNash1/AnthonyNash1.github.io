<p>Since common structure products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold development in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete).

Water vapor frequently condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing during the winter season in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
