<p>Corrosion is a procedure, which transforms refined metals to their more steady oxide. It is the slow and gradual deterioration of materials (normally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion occurs when you combine electricity, metal, oxygen and water, creating iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no dependable timetable for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal parts normally start rusting immediately after the spill, but in some cases your Mac can function typically for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of a problem. How fast the deterioration process takes depends upon a ton of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and for how long the device remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can attend to the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration triggered by a water spill.</p>
