<p>When left alone, mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>

<p>Once standing water is removed, the goal or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has soaked up (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted rooms) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers.

Part of our tracking procedure includes examining ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature also, so cooling a room down with outside air can also set a drying job back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any changes.</p>
