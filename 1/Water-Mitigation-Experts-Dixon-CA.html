<p>Due to the fact that typical building products are capable of sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofing systems, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor travels through ceilings and walls, generally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold development.</p>

When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a personal sewage system can not operate effectively (typical plumbing problems in old homes ). Soil treatment systems for wastewater count on aerobic (with oxygen) regions to reduce the quantities of chemicals and living organisms (infections, bacteria and protozoa). When the soil is saturated or flooded, those harmful products can enter the groundwater and your drinking water system.</p>
