<p>Since typical structure materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is generally related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor commonly condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor passes through walls and ceilings, generally condensing during the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" spots wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
