If the damaged area is little, you can most likely get away with merely covering furnishings with plastic or sheets. But if you're cleaning an entire space, it's wise to remove those clean items and even seal other rooms that are undamaged. Bear in mind the shoes you're using so you do not track soot spots into other spaces.<p>
