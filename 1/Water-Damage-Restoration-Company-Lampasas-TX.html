<p>To eliminate soot and smoke from walls, furniture and floorings, use a moderate soap or detergent or blend together 4 to 6 tablespoon. tri-sodium phosphate and 1 cup home cleaner or chlorine bleach to every gallon of warm water. Use rubber gloves. Make sure to wash surfaces with clear warm water and dry completely. Now, if you are a skilled tech specialist of sorts and know the ins and outs of a phone, and do not mind risking voiding your warranty, you can proceed and take the entire phone apart too. It might help with drying up every piece much faster. Simply take care, if you do not know what you're doing this might cause more damage than great.<p>
<p>In advanced cases of a water damaged floor (ie: major leak or glowing floor heating leakage), fixing the subfloor might even be necessary.

If your screen has been damaged by water if there are lines or dark spots under the glass, you can inform. It is difficult to say whether this damage is going to be irreversible or if it will cause other problems, so the very best thing to do is turn it off and leave it to dry for as long as possible.<p>
