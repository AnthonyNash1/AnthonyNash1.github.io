<p>11. Drywall and other kinds of wall materials normally do not dry effectively, so if your walls are soaked, it's generally best to rip them out to prevent mold, specifically if they aren't completely dry within 2 days.

Move the brush in mindful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health problem. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the area clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
