<p>Since common structure materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is typically related to water or moisture direct exposure and might be caused by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can result in interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
