Standard home fans are not capable of moving an adequate quantity of air needed to dry a room properly.</p>

Air filtration systems are generally used in conjunction with the sealing of the area to eliminate as lots of airborne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the area includes the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, in addition to negative air pressure, which prevents the circulation of air between the contaminated area and the locations around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the location will be switched off to prevent the mold from spreading too.</p>
