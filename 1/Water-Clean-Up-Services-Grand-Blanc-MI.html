<h3>Fire Cleaning Services in Grand Blanc</h3>
<p>Eliminate wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. It can be an irreversible health threat and should be eliminated if soaked by contaminated floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high area from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney result" of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the tip of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and wiring.<p>
