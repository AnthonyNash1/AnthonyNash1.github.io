<h3>Fire And Restoration in Gardner</h3>
<p>A DIY mold remediation item that mold professionals normally recommend is borax - a white powder which you can purchase from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry area. To clean mold using borax, blend the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the option on the surface affected by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush till the mold vanishes. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not use this cleaner on permeable surface areas like drywall. Such materials soak up water quickly. This might exacerbate the problem since as you understand - mold likes moist environments.<p>
