<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they become damp or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum may produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature level, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins exist, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might be present in products that have actually ended up being polluted with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from becoming airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can cause spores to end up being airborne.</p>
