<p>Open doors and windows to remove wetness and smells if the weather condition allows. If the outside humidity becomes higher than within, close things up; similarly, close up your house overnight if temperature levels drop and wet air may otherwise be drawn inside.

<p>Once standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the affected spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is slightly out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring procedure includes inspecting ambient conditions both inside and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the wet air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly based on temperature level too, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying job back days.
