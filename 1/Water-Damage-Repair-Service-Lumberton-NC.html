<p>Corrosion is a process, which transforms refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the progressive and sluggish deterioration of products (usually metals) by chain reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration occurs when you combine electrical power, metal, water and oxygen, creating iron oxide (or what is more frequently referred to as rust). There is no trustworthy schedule for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal parts usually start rusting immediately after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can function typically for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of a problem. How quickly the deterioration procedure takes depends on a lots of factors we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the gadget stayed in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can address the damage. Below are a couple of examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
