<p>When left alone, mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to eliminate mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it in fact assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface and will just eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Another downside of bleach is that it can damage the materials it's utilized on as it is a severe, destructive chemical. Chlorine bleach likewise gives off severe fumes and it even produces harmful gas when combined with ammonia. There are much safer options such as borax or vinegar which do not produce dangerous fumes or leave poisonous residue. For these reasons attempt to prevent using bleach and if you need to utilize it, only use it on non-porous surfaces.</p>
