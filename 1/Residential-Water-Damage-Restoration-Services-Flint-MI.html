<p>Some air cleaners are designed to produce ozone which is a strong oxidizing agent and a known irritant of the lungs and respiratory system. Studies have revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at eliminating airborne mold or surface area mold contamination. Even if mold was killed by ozone, the health risks would not be lowered till mold contaminants are removed through cleaning. Health experts, including the Minnesota Department of Health, do not recommend the use of ozone to deal with mold or any other indoor air issues.</p>
<h3>The Basics of Fire Damage Restoration in Flint</h3>
<p>Examine the drywall to see how much damage has actually been done. Greatly water-infiltrated wallboard will droop from ceilings or collapse to the touch. Get rid of all compromised drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a damaging bar to eliminate it. They may be repairable by cutting out the damaged part if drywall panels just show water discolorations but aren't structurally compromised. When eliminating around the damaged location, utilize a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other family disinfectants will not kill mold. Attempt to keep yourself, children, workers and others out of the afflicted area. Trying to dry the area with a fan may disturb the spores and spread them to a new location. Getting rid of black mold is a step-by-step process that needs persistence, an investment in protective gear and black mold removal items, and, obviously, the courage to brave dark, confined spaces inhabited by hazardous fungus.<p>
