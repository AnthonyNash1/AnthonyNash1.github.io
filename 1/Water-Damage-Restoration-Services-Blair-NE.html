Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying because the leak started, he consented to assist me out on a Sunday early morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He discovered & marked the area of the leakage for me and after that even assisted me closed down my main water valve.
