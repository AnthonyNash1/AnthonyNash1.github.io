<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your home or company is one of the most terrible things that can happen to a household or an individual. Depending upon the damage the hardwood floor may be repaired instead of being totally replaced. If there is small damage then the majority of the floor can be saved and a separated floorboard might need fixing. Nevertheless, if the damage is significant then the entire floor may need changing and sometimes even the subfloor as well. The kind of wood flooring you may have determines and restricts the type of repair work that need to occur. Solid hardwood floor covering allows for a larger range of alternatives to repair the problem. With strong hardwood floorings, you can sand and scrape away as much as a quarter of an inch off the wood to get rid of water damage on the surface area. This kind of flooring can also have replacements for specific planks. The best method to take care of a water damaged area on your wood floor is to replace the afflicted boards and then refinish the whole floor to bring it back to a unifying appearance.</p>
