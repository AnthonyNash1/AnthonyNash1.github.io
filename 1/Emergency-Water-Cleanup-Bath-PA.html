<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many individuals think that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this indicates that the smoke will spread out, harming a much wider area than the fire itself.
