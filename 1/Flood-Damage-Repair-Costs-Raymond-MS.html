<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unknown and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got an expense for $370, and the water company told me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already complete, but when he found out just how much water expense I was paying considering that the leak began, he agreed to help me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 remain in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the place & discovered of the leak for me and after that even helped me closed down my main water valve. Really courteous and easy-going person.</p>
