While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this indicates that the smoke will spread, damaging a much broader area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is permitted to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The very best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a wide location to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
