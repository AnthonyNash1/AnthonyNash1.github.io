Many people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does occur, this implies that the smoke will spread out, harming a much broader location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be.
