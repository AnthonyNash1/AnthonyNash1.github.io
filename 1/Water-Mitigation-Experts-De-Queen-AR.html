<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repair work. By reducing the thickness here, it's much easier to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more noticeable even when the job is finished.<p>

Assessing mold growth includes more than just taking a look at what's noticeably growing on the walls or in a corner. Mold can be an invisible burglar, growing behind and around what you initially see. Such sneaky habits needs analytical thinking.<p>
<p>Mold needs nutrients, water, oxygen and favorable temperatures to grow. Nutrients for mold are present in dead natural material such as wood, paper or fabrics; mold can also obtain nutrients from some synthetic products such as paints and adhesives.
