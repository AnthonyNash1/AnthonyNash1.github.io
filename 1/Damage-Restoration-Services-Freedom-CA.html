<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the same method, so if the location the spores land is great and moist, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>

<p>Class 2 - considerable quantity of absorption, water, and evaporation load. Water invasion where damp, porous materials (e.g., carpet, gypsum board, fiber-fill insulation, concrete masonry unit (CMU), fabrics) represent l ~ 5% to ~ 40% of the combined floor, wall, and ceiling surface area in the area; and where products described as low evaporation products (e.g., plaster, wood, concrete, masonry) or low evaporation assemblies (e.g., multilayer wallboard, multilayer subfloors, health club floorings, or other complex, built-up assemblies) have soaked up very little wetness.</p>
<p>Often water flows hidden down the inside of wall cavities. Other times standing water will wick up a wall. Unless water spots appear, this wetness might go undiscovered up until molds and smell issues occur. This is one of the factors an expert is equipped with the proper instruments to spot and find wet locations prior to the drying process begins. Today's restoration is more than drying damp carpets.</p>
