In order to get an even, ended up look, it's important to avoid joining bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the job is completed, this helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
