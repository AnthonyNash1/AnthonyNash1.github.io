<p>Fire Damage is the most devastating sort of property damage that a household or business can experience. Once MacBook water damage has happened, the liquid will likely make its way to the logic board and other elements. The liquid's minerals and salts instantly start to gnaw at the metal, silicone and fiberglass components. Often, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and after that stop working. This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a source of power offered, such as a battery, which is supplying power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electrical current will engage with the liquid and accelerate this rust process. This causes the copper and other metals to move across the board. If this rust process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight.</p>
