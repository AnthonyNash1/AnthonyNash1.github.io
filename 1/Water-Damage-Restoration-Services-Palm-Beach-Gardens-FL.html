<p>For the victims captured up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air up until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and sprout. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is good and damp, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>To get rid of mold in the basement, scrub the walls utilizing a big brush, and keep in mind that porous surfaces such as ceiling tiles or drywall might require to be gotten rid of and changed.
