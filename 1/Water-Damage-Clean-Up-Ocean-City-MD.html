<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. During a water loss emergency, almost every location of your Seattle home could be at danger for damage.

<p>Because typical building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is generally connected to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold growth. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, enabling mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" identifies wetness from concrete slabs without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as sleek concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
