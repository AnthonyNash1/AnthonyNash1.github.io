Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not wish to take the work at first as his schedule was currently full, however when he found out how much water expense I was paying since the leakage started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 remain in his complete uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leak for me and after that even helped me shut down my primary water valve.
