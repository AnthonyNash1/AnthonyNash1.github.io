<p>Fire is the result of a chain reaction between the oxygen that exists in the environment and a source of combustible fuel. As soon as this combustible fuel - furniture, carpet, or drywall - has been heated to its distinct ignition temperature, the fuel will catch fire and unstable gases will be released in the type of smoke. While smoke and the residue it leaves can cause enduring damage and must be dealt with by knowledgeable experts, heat is the most noticeable, and destructive, item of this chemical reaction. What's more, fire is self-perpetuating - implying that as a fire enters contact with additional fuel, the reaction continues and the fire spreads.</p>
<p>Air Cleaning: Right away we equip the residential or commercial property with air scrubbers. We often will set one unit for every 2 to 3 rooms, depending on the size of the space. These units have a consumption and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it goes through three filters, among which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which indicates that they remove at least 99.99% of particles as small 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has been cleaned up and much of the odor got rid of. This process goes on for days. As you can envision, throughout a number of days, the air that comes in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less smell so, with time and efficient air scrubbing, we start the air cleaning and ventilating treatments.</p>
