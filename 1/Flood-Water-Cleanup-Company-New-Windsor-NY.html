<p>Water invasion into structures can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his men were incredible in helping us survive flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to monitor and change the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the expenses and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
