<p>To prevent mold in the basement, you need to modify the conditions that can cause it to grow. Initially, eliminate moisture by setting up a dehumidifier and making sure the clothes dryer vent exhausts externally, if you use your basement for laundry. Then turn your attention outside: Support fractures and other structure issues, and ensure that your soil is correctly graded so that rainwater or melting snow goes away from the house, rather than gathering near your foundation.</p>
<h3>Fire Damage Claims in Bryan - Tips for Filing an Insurance Claim</h3>
<p>Eliminate paneling, wallboard and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when damp. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health danger and should be gotten rid of. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This develops a "chimney impact" of air motion for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, however utilize only the pointer of the blade and look out for pipes, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
