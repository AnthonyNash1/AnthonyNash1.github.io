<h2>Effects of Water Damage in Brigantine</h2>

<p>Mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, including bleach, have actually been shown inadequate against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually assists in mold development. The chlorine particles stay on the surface area and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>If a pipe in your home has leaked for months and gone without repairs, mold can grow as a result, however it won't be covered by your property owners insurance. Considering that floods can also cause mold, any potential mold that grows as an outcome of a flood would be covered by flood insurance, if you have it. Must you submit a claim for mold damage, this cause would be evaluated and figured out by the flood insurance adjuster.</p>
