<h3>Affordable Fire Restoration in Nebo</h3>
<p>Eliminate plaster, wallboard and paneling to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a long-term health risk and ought to be removed if soaked by infected floodwater. If the majority of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, think about cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls.

A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use just the idea of the blade and keep an eye out for pipelines, ductwork and circuitry.<p>
