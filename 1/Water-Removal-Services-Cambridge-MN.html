<p>Water intrusion into buildings can be extremely harmful. Jake and his people were incredible in assisting us make it through flooding from Cyclone Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying out our drenched crawlspace instantly. They returned every day (typically twice a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the way and also were extremely practical in coordinating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
