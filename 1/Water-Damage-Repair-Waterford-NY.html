<p>Experiencing a disaster that requires fire damage cleanup in your house or service is one of the most disastrous things that can happen to a person or a household. To begin dealing with a water damaged wall or ceiling in your house, you must determine the source of the water. It is possible for water to take a trip far from the website of the leakage and trigger damage in other places, in unanticipated areas.

<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on materials such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being moist or water-damaged. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some stress of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other elements. When mycotoxins are present, they take place in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in materials that have become contaminated with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a wet slime layer covers its spores, preventing them from becoming airborne. When the mold passes away and dries up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
