<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a poisonous, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does. Lots of people believe that because smoke increases into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this means that the smoke will spread, harming a much wider area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more extensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
