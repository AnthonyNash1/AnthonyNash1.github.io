<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to assess which drying devices or approaches will be the most efficient.

These conditions can assist in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, hidden and sensible energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly anticipates the energy examination of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they react to each one and provide the best evaporation results. The greater the number, the quicker materials will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more useful if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
