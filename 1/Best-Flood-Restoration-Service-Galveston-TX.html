<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape.

Once the meters check out moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the service technician will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the location. At this point, the water remediation process is thought about to complete.<p>
