Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get damp and just begins to sag before drying out, fixing it may just require pressing it back into location, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
