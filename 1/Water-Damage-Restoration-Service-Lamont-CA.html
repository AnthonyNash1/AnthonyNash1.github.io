<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase significantly if action isn't taken. Did you understand that smoke is really made from little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surface areas it touches, just as fire does.

While diffusion-- the spread of a substance from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread, harming a much larger location than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is allowed to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration methods will involve searching a wide area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
