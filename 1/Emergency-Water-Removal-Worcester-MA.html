<p>The location that is being dealt with is sealed, as mold spores can quickly take a trip as soon as they are interrupted. Air filtration systems are generally utilized in conjunction with the sealing of the location to remove as numerous air-borne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the area involves the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative atmospheric pressure, which avoids the flow of air in between the contaminated area and the locations around it. All heating, cooling, and fans in the area will be switched off to avoid the mold from spreading also.</p>

Mold testing options consist of air-cell tests and swab samples to identify the types and concentrations of mold present in an environment. When the source and types of mold are determined, a mold removal plan will be developed and performed, consisting of containment of the workspace to limit the spread and control of mold in the house or other impurities into surrounding areas of the home.</p>
