<h3>The Role Of Professionals In Smoke Damage Cleanup in Pelham</h3>
<p>When you are planning big repairs, remember that drywall includes a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the remainder of the sheet. By lowering the thickness here, it's much easier to hide long taped joints under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it's important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also remember that since wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally attached so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical seams in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the job is finished.<p>
