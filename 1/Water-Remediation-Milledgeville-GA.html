<p>I required an emergency water leakage detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the present rate, my next expense will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying because the leakage started, he agreed to assist me out on a Sunday early morning!
