<p>Since common building materials can sustaining mold growth and mold spores are common, mold development in an indoor environment is usually connected to water or wetness exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through walls and ceilings, normally condensing throughout the winter in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
