Nevertheless, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product need to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall comes in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with full sheets.

<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are preparing large repairs. By lowering the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, finished appearance, it is very important to prevent signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Likewise bear in mind that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps strengthen the strength of the wall and helps separate vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even when the task is completed.<p>
