Called Allied, signed work order on line and workers were at the house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of equipment to mitigate the damage. Drying fans were set up, heating pads were placed on hardwood floorings, walls and ceilings were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes set up. Excellent, expert care. Very pleased with their swift delivery of emergency service AND their attention to detail to make sure the water damage was dried out entirely.</p>
