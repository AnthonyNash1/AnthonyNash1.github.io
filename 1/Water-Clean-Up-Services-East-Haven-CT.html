<p>It's not simply a catch phrase! As an in your area owned and operated business, we are prepared to respond rapidly and expediently with the right tools and understanding to get the job done FAST. After a heavy rain storm, a fast reaction is CRITICAL to minimizing prospective secondary damages and costs to your Portland home or organisation. Drying out after water damage ought to top any cleanup priority list.
