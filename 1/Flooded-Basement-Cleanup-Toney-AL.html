<p>Recent Review: We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was dripping. They fasted to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and hauled away whatever else.  We were very happy that we didn't have to lift a finger.  When they came back the next service day to do demolition and the water damage clean up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were extremely professional and hardworking.  I could not believe they got so much performed in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to check in and I feel confident in their knowledge and abilities to finish the job effectively. I would advise them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>For security reasons, they likewise recognize the kind of water they're handling prior to beginning the water restoration cleanup process. You might try powering your phone on at this moment to evaluate the damage, but we advise taking an additional action prior to running the risk of turning the phone on. Immerse your phone in a desiccant-- a compound that will cause dryness by absorbing water. That's just an elegant method of stating, grab the rice.<p>
<p>So how do we look after water damage restoration? Naturally, it might vary depending upon the degree and type of water damage. We follow a set of standards that makes sure that every base is covered while we repair the damage. RestorePro did an amazing job professionally, quickly, and beautifully assisted us in protecting our company. I can not advise their services with a high adequate star score and while I hope not to have to need their services in the future, if the need did arise, there is no other company that I would call to assist. HIGHY RECOMMEND.<p>
