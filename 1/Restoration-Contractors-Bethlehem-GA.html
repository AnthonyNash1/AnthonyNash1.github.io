<h3>Fire Damage Cleaning Services in Bethlehem</h3>
<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repairs. By reducing the thickness here, it's simpler to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the remainder of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up appearance, it is essential to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Likewise remember that given that wall studs are vertical, drywall is generally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. This helps reinforce the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even when the task is ended up.<p>
