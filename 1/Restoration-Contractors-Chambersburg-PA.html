<p>The location that is being treated is sealed, as mold spores can quickly take a trip when they are disrupted. Air purification systems are normally used in combination with the sealing of the area to eliminate as many airborne spores as possible and to prevent spread. Sealing the area includes the use of both physical barriers, such as plastic sheeting, along with negative atmospheric pressure, which prevents the blood circulation of air between the infected space and the areas around it.
