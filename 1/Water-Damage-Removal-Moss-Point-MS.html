<p>When water freezes, it expands, and that can be an issue for your home. Frozen water can cause pipelines to burst, causing expensive and unpleasant repair. Thankfully, there are steps you can require to prevent a water disaster. As the temperature drops, keep a consistent drip of water running to help prevent freezing. Pay unique attention to pipelines in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other places that might not be getting the very same amount of heat as other locations in your house. Wrapping them in a layer of insulation can go a long way in preventing a burst.</p>
