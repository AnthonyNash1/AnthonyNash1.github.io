Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was currently complete, however when he discovered how much water bill I was paying because the leakage started, he accepted help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his complete uniform and all the devices. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even assisted me shut down my primary water valve.
