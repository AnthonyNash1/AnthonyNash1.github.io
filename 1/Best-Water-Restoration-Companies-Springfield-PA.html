<h3>Smoke Damage Restoration Service in Springfield</h3>

To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the option on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush up until the mold disappears. Due to the fact that borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no requirement to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall.
