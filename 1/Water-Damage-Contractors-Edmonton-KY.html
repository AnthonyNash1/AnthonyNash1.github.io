<p>Indoor mold development can usually be seen or smelled. Most of the times, if noticeable mold growth is present, sampling is not needed. There are no health or exposure-based requirements that you can use to assess a mold sampling outcome.

Sampling for mold in the air can be pricey and, if done, ought to just be done by experienced experts. Examine a mold issue; do not test</p>
<p>During a flood cleanup, the indoor air quality in your home or workplace might seem the least of your problems.

Standing water and wet products are a breeding ground for microorganisms, such as infections, bacteria, and mold. They can trigger disease, trigger allergic reactions, and continue to damage products long after the flood.</p>
