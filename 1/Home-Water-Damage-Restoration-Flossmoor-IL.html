<p>Stachybotrys chartarum (also known as Stachybotrys atra) is a greenish-black mold that can grow on products such as drywall or sheetrock, ceiling tiles and wood when they end up being water-damaged or damp. Not all greenish-black molds are Stachybotrys chartarum. Some pressures of Stachybotrys chartarum might produce mycotoxins. Whether a mold produces mycotoxins depends upon what the mold is growing on and conditions such as temperature, pH, humidity or other aspects. When mycotoxins are present, they happen in both living and dead mold spores, and might exist in products that have actually ended up being infected with molds. While Stachybotrys is growing, a damp slime layer covers its spores, avoiding them from ending up being air-borne. When the mold dries and dies up, air currents or physical handling can trigger spores to end up being airborne.</p>
