However, failure to remove contaminated products and to minimize moisture and humidity can present serious long-lasting health risks.

There is no trusted timetable for this procedure to occur; a MacBook's internal parts generally start wearing away instantly after the spill, however in some cases your Mac can work usually for days or weeks without showing any obvious indication of an issue. How fast the deterioration process takes depends upon a lots of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the severity of the spill, and the length of time the device remained in contact with the liquid. The very best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all until you can resolve the damage. Below are a few examples of rust brought on by a water spill.</p>
