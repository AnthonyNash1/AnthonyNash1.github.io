<p>If you have water damage, It is necessary to call a professional quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is really made of little particles of the fire itself? It's a toxic, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that due to the fact that smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it merely goes away. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does happen, this implies that the smoke will spread, damaging a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will involve searching a large location to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
