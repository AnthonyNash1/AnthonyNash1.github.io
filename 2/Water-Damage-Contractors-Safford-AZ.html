<p>Due to the fact that mold and mildew can be a major health risk, it's not uncommon in cases when flooding is less than 12 inches to eliminate approximately 18 inches of drywall. However, FEMA recommends that if the water level was less than 2 1/2 feet, the wall material need to be removed to a height of 4 feet. As drywall can be found in 4' x 8' sheets, this makes it simpler to replace the damage with complete sheets. If the water level was higher than 2 1/2 feet, the wall product should be removed to a height of 8 feet or approximately the ceiling joint, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>Recent Review: I required an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing someplace unidentified and water meter was jumping up like crazy (I got a costs for $370, and the water company informed me if it's addressing the current rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at very first as his schedule was already complete, but when he learnt just how much water expense I was paying because the leak started, he consented to help me out on a Sunday early morning! He appeared on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the equipment. He found & marked the place of the leakage for me and then even helped me shut down my main water valve. Very respectful and easy-going individual.</p>
