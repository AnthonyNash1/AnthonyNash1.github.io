<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether at home or work, it can be one of the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air up until they land somewhere. Think of planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the same way, so if the location the spores land is wet and good, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>

<p>Rust is a procedure, which converts refined metals to their more stable oxide. It is the slow and progressive deterioration of products (typically metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the corrosion happens when you combine electrical power, water, metal and oxygen, producing iron oxide (or what is more frequently known as rust). There is no trustworthy schedule for this procedure to take place; a MacBook's internal elements normally start wearing away instantly after the spill, but in many cases your Mac can function usually for days or weeks without showing any apparent sign of a problem. How fast the corrosion process takes depends upon a ton of aspects we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and the length of time the device remained in contact with the liquid. The best practice is to not power on or use the MacBook at all up until you can deal with the damage. Below are a few examples of deterioration triggered by a water spill.</p>
