<p>We called them out to examine water damage in our cooking area after we found our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift cooking area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were extremely pleased that we didn't need to raise a finger.  When they returned the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were really professional and hardworking.  I could not think they got a lot performed in one day!  Somebody has actually come out each day to check in and I feel great in their understanding and abilities to finish the job correctly.
