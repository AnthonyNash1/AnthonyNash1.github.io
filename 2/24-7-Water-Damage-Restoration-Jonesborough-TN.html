<p>Current Review: I needed an emergency water leak detection work done as water was gushing somewhere unknown and water meter was leaping up like insane (I got a bill for $370, and the public utility informed me if it's addressing the existing rate, my next costs will be over $600). Simon, the owner of Clear Water did not want to take the work at first as his schedule was already full, however when he found out just how much water bill I was paying since the leak started, he accepted assist me out on a Sunday morning! He showed up on a Sunday at 9 am in his full uniform and all the devices. He marked the location & found of the leak for me and then even assisted me shut down my main water valve. Really polite and easy-going person.</p>
