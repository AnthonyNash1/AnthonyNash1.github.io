<h2>What You Need to Know About Flood Insurance in Kennebunk</h2>

<p>Mold can cause severe health concerns through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not know is that many chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven inefficient versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact assists in mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only eliminate a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Prior to your home has dried out, scrub floors and woodwork with a stiff brush, lots of water, a detergent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by polluted floodwater must be removed and discarded unless it can be sanitized at an industrial center for an expense considerably less than replacement. Vinyl flooring and floor tile might require to be gotten rid of to enable drying of subfloor.</p>
<h3>Hardwood Floor Water Damage in Kennebunk Maine</h2>
<p>We just recently had significant water damage due to a washing machine overflow. Rainbow came out to your house on a Sunday night over a three-day weekend and continued to take the action essential to prevent further damage burning the midnight oil into the night. They also completed the whole dry out which took a number of days and a lot of hard work. Always gotten here on time and did what they guaranteed and kept me informed of each action. It was a satisfaction to handle the entire group. I would not hesitate to advise them for any work of this nature consisting of mold repair and restoration work.</p>
<p>As soon as standing water is gotten rid of, the goal or our drying equipment is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in locations where water has actually absorbed (this will temporarily increase the humidity in the impacted spaces) and b) eliminate the wetness in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is somewhat out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our monitoring process consists of inspecting ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can benefit from low humidity outdoors, we might choose to open a window or door to momentarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is heavily depending on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outside air can also set a drying project back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service technicians before you make any changes.</p>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide kills mold as it is anti-fungal along with anti-viral and anti-bacterial. Hydrogen peroxide is a great option to chlorine bleach since it is safe to use and does not damage the environment, nor does it leave toxic residue or produce poisonous fumes like chlorine bleach does. You can buy hydrogen peroxide from drug stores for around one dollar for a bottle of 3% concentration.</p>

Oftentimes the very first sign there is an issue, and there is water damage, is when individual planks are cupping or numerous start to crown triggering a bulge in the floor. Water absorption in the wood of your floor triggers expansion, which is most visible in the edges of the board that are turning up or when slabs start to buckle. When a dark or black stain runs along the edge of a slab or across numerous, another alerting sign that water damage has actually taken place is. When this kind of stain shows up it is frequently due to mold development These water damaged signs originate from a consistent water source that might have originated from a leakage of some kind within your home.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other household disinfectants will not kill mold. Attempt to keep yourself, children, staff members and others out of the affected area. Attempting to dry the area with a fan may disrupt the spores and spread them to a new area.
