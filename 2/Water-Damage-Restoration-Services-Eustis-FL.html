<p>Fire Damage is the most terrible sort of property damage that a family or company can experience. As soon as MacBook water damage has taken place, the liquid will likely make its method to the logic board and other components. The liquid's minerals and salts immediately begin to eat away at the metal, silicone and fiberglass elements. Frequently, the Mac will work for a few days after the spill and then stop working. This is due to the metals oxidizing and gradually wearing away. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer is off), the electric current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration process. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with a very expensive paperweight if this rust procedure is not stopped.</p>
