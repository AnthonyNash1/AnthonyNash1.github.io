<p>Mold can trigger severe health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that most chemicals, including bleach, have actually been proven ineffective against removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just kill a portion of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>Amongst the items we utilize to address mold concerns is the resurfacing agent Microorganism Guard, which produces a new, long-term layer over a surface area. By withstanding microbial attacks, the new surface can seal out mold, offering it no chance to grow. However Microorganism Guard is simply one element of our well-rounded services. A cornerstone of our approach to mold remediation is thorough avoidance that obstructs the regrowth of damaging mold. Individuals developing a brand-new home or structure will find our prevention techniques especially important.</p>
