<h2>The Types of Water Damage in Albany</h2>
<p><center><img src="https://waterdamageimages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/restoration-services.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="350"></center><p>
<p>Mold can cause serious health issues through airborne pathogens when left alone. What you might not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have been shown ineffective versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold growth.</p>
