These consist of cold-like symptoms, rashes, sinus inflammation, eye inflammation and aggravation of asthma. Some signs are more general - such as failure to focus or tiredness. Generally, symptoms disappear after the mold is removed. Mitigation is considered an emergency service. Water has the destructive propensity to cause prevalent damage to materials that absorb it.
