<p>Due to the fact that common building products are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically connected to water or moisture direct exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of flooring materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing problems can cause interior mold growth. Water vapor frequently condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to flourish. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, normally condensing throughout the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floorings, are mold-prone.
