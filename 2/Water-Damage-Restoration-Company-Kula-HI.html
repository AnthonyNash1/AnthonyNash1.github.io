I would 100% suggest calling them for aid. Once we discovered our water leak upstairs their mitigation group was here in no time (on a Friday night). Phillip was professional, friendly and helped me understand the procedure of what would be happening to fix and repair our home. I could inform each and every employee I met was picked because of their professionalism and attention to information. The completed item was beyond our expectations. I'm actually fussy about the work that is done in my home, notice all the information and was impressed with the finished result. Their group worked with quickly with our insurance coverage.

Jake was extremely responsive to emails and calls responding to concerns throughout the process. All in all, I had an excellent experience with Jake and Carolina Water Damage Restoration.</p>
