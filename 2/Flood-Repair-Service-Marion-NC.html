An automated shut-off valve is excellent insurance coverage to have in any circumstance, especially when the water heater unit is located inside the home.

The culprit may have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve needing replacing or something disastrous like a tank failure.</p>
<p>When water freezes, it expands, and that can be a problem for your home. Frozen water can trigger pipes to burst, causing unpleasant and pricey repair.

Pay unique attention to pipes in basements, garages, the back of cabinets, and other places that might not be getting the exact same amount of heat as other areas in your house.
