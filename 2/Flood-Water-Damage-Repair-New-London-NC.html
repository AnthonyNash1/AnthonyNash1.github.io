<p>To purchase time, location damp books and photos into plastic bags and place in a frost-free freezer. This will stop extra wear and tear, and avoid mold and mildew. When you have time, obtain books from the freezer and air- or fan-dry the pages. Mold can grow just about anywhere, but it usually flourishes in warm, humid or wet environments It can also often be found in drier environments that have poor ventilation or air circulation.<p>
<p>If you're working with a smaller hole (as much as 6"), use a thin layer of joint substance around the hole. Position your spot into the hole. Using a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the compound. Feather the edges of the substance and permit it to dry. Sand gently with a fine-grit sandpaper and apply a second layer of joint compound to end up the repair. As water and storm damage specialists, we have the experience and advanced training that enables us to restore your property quickly. We utilize scientific drying concepts and provide validation and paperwork that your residential or commercial property is dry and the task is complete.<p>
<p>Don't try or touch to clean carpets, upholstered furnishings, drapes or other home textile products. Those cleaning actions will just smear soot into the fabric, making cleaning more difficult. Use a dry, absorbent fabric to wipe down the phone. Get all of the excess wetness off with an absorbent cloth. Make sure to get the moisture out of the charging port, the volume keys, the headphone jack and any other crevices.<p>
