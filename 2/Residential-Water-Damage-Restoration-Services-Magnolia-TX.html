<p>A DIY mold remediation product that mold professionals normally suggest is borax - a white powder which you can buy from the grocery, at the detergent or laundry section. To clean mold utilizing borax, blend the powder in one gallon of hot water. Apply the solution on the surface affected by mold and scrub the area with a rug or brush till the mold disappears. Since borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. Nevertheless, do not utilize this cleaner on porous surfaces like drywall. Such products take in water easily.
