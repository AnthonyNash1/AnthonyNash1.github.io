As mentioned, quick air movement throughout wet surfaces of assemblies or products is a vital element of successfully and effectively drying the surface area of those products and assemblies. Conditions conducive to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess wetness within the materials or assemblies. Rapid air motion across the surface of material becomes less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface area wetness paves the way to decreasing moisture material in low evaporation materials. The continuous and falling rates of drying products require different requirements for changing conditions.</p>
