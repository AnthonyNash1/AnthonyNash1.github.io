Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both indoors and out, and if we can make the most of low humidity outdoors, we may elect to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a room down with outside air can likewise set a drying task back days. If you have questions on this, we ask that you please inquire with our service professionals prior to you make any changes.</p>
