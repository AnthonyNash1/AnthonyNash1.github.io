<p>Examination reports and lawsuits by seven next-door neighbors on the block now allege that construction defects permitted water to gush into her walls. In the Shorts' home, a moisture-inspection test revealed that some parts of their wall had likely broken down and developed mold.

At Jackson's, the stucco was not sufficiently sealed around some pipes, an inspector stated, permitting water to drip in and take a trip through her walls.</p>
