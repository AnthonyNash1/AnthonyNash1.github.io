Inspect recommendations and ask the contractor to follow the suggestions in EPA's" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Buildings, the guidelines of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the Guidelines of the New York City City Department of Health and Mental Health (NYCDOHMM), the industry requirements published by the Institute of Evaluation, Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC) or other appropriate standards from industry, expert or federal government organizations.</p>
