<p>Water invasion into buildings can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his men were fantastic in helping us survive flooding from Hurricane Florence. They were quick to get to your home and started drying out our soaked crawlspace right away. They returned every day (often twice a day) to monitor and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They discussed whatever they were doing along the way and likewise were really handy in collaborating efforts with the insurance coverage adjuster. They were more than reasonable on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>

<p>Eliminate wallboard, paneling and plaster to a minimum of the flood level. Wallboard imitates a sponge when damp. It can be a permanent health hazard and should be eliminated if soaked by infected floodwater.
