<p>Get rid of wallboard, paneling and plaster to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. It can be a permanent health threat and must be removed if soaked by polluted floodwater. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This produces a "chimney effect" of air movement for faster drying.
