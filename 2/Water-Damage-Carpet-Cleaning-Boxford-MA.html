<p>Remember that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning large repair work.

When the job is completed, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and assists break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more obvious even.<p>
