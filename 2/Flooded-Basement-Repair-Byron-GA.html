<p>For the victims caught up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most traumatizing and frightening experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same method, so if the location the spores land is great and damp, mold can begin to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>

Using bleach on these products will eliminate the mold above the surface however the roots within the product will stay and the mold will quickly return.</p>
