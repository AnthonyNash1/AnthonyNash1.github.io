<p>If you have water damage, It's important to call a professional rapidly, as the damage can increase substantially if action isn't taken. Did you know that smoke is in fact made of small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot compound that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does. Many people believe that since smoke rises into the air, diffusion occurs, and it simply disappears. While diffusion-- the spread of a compound from high concentration to lower concentration-- does take place, this implies that the smoke will spread, harming a much larger area than the fire itself. And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more comprehensive the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration approaches will involve browsing a broad area to tidy up and repair smoke damage.</p>
