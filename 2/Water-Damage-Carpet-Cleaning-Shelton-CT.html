<p>Mold can trigger serious health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. What you may not understand is that the majority of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been proven inefficient against eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you apply bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it actually helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>
<p>The most effective water damage restoration projects begin with a comprehensive extraction; our proprietary extraction devices will start things off on the best foot. We will then provide you with a drying strategy and the appropriate devices to finish the process. We invest greatly in the most updated drying devices to manage the drying process. Advanced examination tools will validate the drying process and even help in finding any covert pockets of water.</p>
