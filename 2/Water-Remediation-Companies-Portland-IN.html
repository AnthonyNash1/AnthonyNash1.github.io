<p>Find out how to remove black mold safely and efficiently. Emergency flooding, pipes leakages or burst pipelines can quickly lead to residential or commercial property damage and effect the safety of you and your family.

<p>Due to the fact that common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are common, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and may be triggered by incomplete drying of flooring products (such as concrete). Flooding, leaky roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can result in interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surfaces cooler than the moisture-laden air, making it possible for mold to grow. 8 This moisture vapor goes through ceilings and walls, typically condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl spaces and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" finds moisture from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some products, such as polished concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
