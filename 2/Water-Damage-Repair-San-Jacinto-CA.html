Then the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Getting it damp can turn into a significant headache because the gypsum drywall is porous and soluble in water. Wet drywall will take in water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in location. In the case where drywall does get damp and simply starts to sag prior to drying, fixing it may just require pushing it back into location, securing it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
