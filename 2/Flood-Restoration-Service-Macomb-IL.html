<p>When left alone, mold can cause serious health concerns through air-borne pathogens. What you might not understand is that most chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus removing mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it actually helps with mold development. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold growth.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Fire Damage in Macomb</h3>
<p>If your home has mold you need to make sure it is it looked after as soon as you can.  Mold can spread out really rapidly, and it is more than just black spots. As it grows, it can break down the "food" that supports it, which can be the wood studs supporting your walls, the sheetrock itself, or any other organic, permeable materials in your house. That can be bad news for your home, not to mention for your health.<p>
<p>After the flood waters recede and the clean up has actually been done, the majority of folks want to return into their services or houses and start reconstructing. The issue is that wood that has actually been submerged in water has most likely taken in a large amount of water. Reconstructing too rapidly after a flood can cause continuing problems such as mold growth, insect invasions, and degeneration of the wood and wall coverings.<p>
