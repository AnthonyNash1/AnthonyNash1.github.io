<p>If you have water damage, It is very important to call an expert quickly, as the damage can increase considerably if action isn't taken. The psychrometric chart offers us with the tools to assess which drying devices or methods will be the most effective.

These conditions can help in determining what devices to utilize on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and hidden energy, can be determined by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Assessment Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula accurately anticipates the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they respond to each one and supply the best evaporation outcomes. The higher the number, the much faster products will dry. Using this formula, desiccants are more handy if the outdoors grains per pound of moisture are lower.</p>
