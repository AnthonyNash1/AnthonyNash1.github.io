Make sure that you get to the root cause of the molds and you need to open the walls to find them. Scrub the surface areas with a mold cleaner and do this completely. After scrubbing, leave the solution for a little while to permit it to permeate through the wood or wall. While the mold cleaner is embeding in, you may now clean up the wall particles.
