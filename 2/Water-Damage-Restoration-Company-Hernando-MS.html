<p>For the victims caught up in or impacted by a fire, whether in your home or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like small seeds, floating through the air until they land somewhere. Consider planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same way, so if the location the spores land is great and wet, mold can begin to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a huge problem on your hands.</p>
<p>Water damage can be the beginning point for lots of serious problems that can impact a structure, damage personal property and present major health threats to residents. To bring back residential or commercial property and protect health, an expert restoration contractor should carefully handle the task.

In addition, they should have the ability to communicate with the water damage victims and insurer agents with confidence and authority. Water damaged structures can be the ideal breeding place for mold, while bad indoor ventilation can trigger molds to prosper. Wet structure products and humid indoor air are mold's best friends.</p>

Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we might elect to open a window or door to temporarily purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly depending on temperature level also, so cooling a room down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days.
