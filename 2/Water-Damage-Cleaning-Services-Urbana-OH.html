To clean mold using borax, mix the powder in one gallon of warm water. Use the solution on the surface area impacted by mold and scrub the location with a carpet or brush until the mold disappears. Because borax will keep the mold from coming back, there's no need to rinse it off. However, do not use this cleaner on porous surface areas like drywall. Such products absorb water quickly.
