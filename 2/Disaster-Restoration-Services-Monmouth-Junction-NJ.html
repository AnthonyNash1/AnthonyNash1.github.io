<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, many professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. Nevertheless, paper tape isn't always hassle-free. Utilizing paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth learning. When the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the service technician will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area.
