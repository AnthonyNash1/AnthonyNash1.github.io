<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape seems to be more convenient due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, numerous professional drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't constantly convenient. Using paper tape needs some practice and little finesse, however it's well worth learning. Once the meters read wetness levels equal to the previous dry state of the space, the professional will remove the fans and dehumidifiers from the area.
