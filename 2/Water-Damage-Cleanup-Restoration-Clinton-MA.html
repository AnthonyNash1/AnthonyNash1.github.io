By reducing the density here, it's simpler to hide long taped seams under a number of coats of joint compound. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, completed appearance, it is necessary to avoid signing up with bound edges to butt edges. Also bear in mind that considering that wall studs are vertical, drywall is normally connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs. When the task is finished, this helps enhance the strength of the wall and helps break up vertical joints in the drywall that tend to be more visible even.<p>
