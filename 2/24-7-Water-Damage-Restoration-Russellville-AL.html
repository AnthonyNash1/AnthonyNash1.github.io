<p>Discover how to eliminate black mold safely and successfully. Classification 3 - Category 3 water is grossly infected and can include pathogenic, toxigenic, or other hazardous agents. Examples of Classification 3 water can include, but are not limited to: sewage; toilet backflows that originate from beyond the toilet trap no matter noticeable content or color; all forms of flooding from seawater; ground surface water and increasing water from rivers or streams; and other polluted water entering or affecting the indoor environment, such as wind-driven rain from hurricanes, tropical storms, or other weather associated occasions.

A special HEPA vacuum guarantees that even tiny particles get gathered to minimize the chances of the mold moving somewhere else. This help in our efforts at containment of the mold. We wish to make twice as sure that mold doesn't find a way out of the contained workspace and into a various part of the structure.</p>
