<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be among the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, drifting through the air until they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with wetness and nutrients, then the seed will grow and grow. Mold works the exact same method, so if the place the spores land is great and wet, mold can start to grow, spread, and make more mold spores. All it requires is time, and you can have a big issue on your hands.</p>
<p>Even when you include a small indoor fire, smoke damage can take place.

Likewise, since it's in the air, it's nearly impossible to include. Even after a fire is snuffed out, smoke in the air can trigger damage. Smoke damage restoration services are often required to restore damage left from small indoor fires.</p>
