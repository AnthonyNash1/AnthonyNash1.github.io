Because case, you'll need to cut out these water-damaged areas as soon as possible. When evaluating how to repair ceiling drywall when it's damp and drooping, it's possible that it could have water ponding above you.

<p>Examine the drywall to see just how much damage has actually been done. Greatly water-infiltrated wallboard will sag from ceilings or fall apart to the touch. Get rid of all jeopardized drywall by hand or use the claw end of a hammer or a trashing bar to eliminate it. If drywall panels just reveal water discolorations but aren't structurally compromised, they may be repairable by eliminating the damaged part. When cutting out around the damaged area, use a keyhole saw to cut the hole into a square or rectangular shape. You can then make a patch with another piece of drywall for the repair.<p>
<p>We also supply safe sewage cleanup and sewage removal if you have found yourself dealing with sewage damage. Raw sewage is hard to cleanup and can be very hazardous.
