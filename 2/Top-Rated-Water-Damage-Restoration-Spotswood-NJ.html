<p>When a customer calls with a water damage emergency, our team is prepared to react instantly.

<p>The air to be dried, or processed, is ducted through the rotor in one air stream. The rotor brings the moist desiccant to the reactivation jet stream to heat it up.

This procedure soaks up moisture without ice accumulation and is not limited by low temperature levels. Desiccants can quickly operate below freezing temperatures.</p>
