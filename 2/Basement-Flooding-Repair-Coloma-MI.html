Warm air between about 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal, specifically for the first 36 to 48 hours of drying and is the optimum temperature for the operation of low grain dehumidifiers. Cooler air slows evaporation, so being warmer than 70 degrees Fahrenheit aids in the evaporation procedure. Excessively hot air above 90 degrees Fahrenheit hinders the dehumidifiers' efficiency.<p>
