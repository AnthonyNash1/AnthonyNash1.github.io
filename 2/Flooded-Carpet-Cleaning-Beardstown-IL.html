<p>Any structure that has struggled with water damage or problems with excess moisture is at danger of mold growth. Wear a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore security, and cover legs, arms and hands to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to remove visible mold.

Next, utilize industrial black mold removal products, which can be found in the majority of hardware or home repair stores, to disinfect the moldy locations, in addition to any adjacent areas.
