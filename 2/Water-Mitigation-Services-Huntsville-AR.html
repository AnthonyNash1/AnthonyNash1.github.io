Water mitigation is about far more than just drying and cleaning a residential or commercial property. There are lots of other factors to think about, like decontamination and dealing with porous products (e.g. carpet or drywall) that can hold water. Germs can possibly grow and cause future issues if left moist or neglected.<p>

If there is a great deal of mold growth, seek advice from the U.S. Epa's assistance:" Mold Remediation in Schools and Commercial Structures ". Printable versions of these and other assistance files are readily available on the EPA's Publications on Mold webpage If the musty material is not quickly cleanable, such as drywall, carpet padding and insulation, then removal and replacement may be required.<p>
