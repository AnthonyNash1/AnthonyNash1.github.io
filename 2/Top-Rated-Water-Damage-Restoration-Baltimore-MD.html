Wet drywall will soak up water and grow heavy to pull off from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the case where drywall does get wet and simply begins to sag prior to drying, repairing it may simply require pressing it back into place, protecting it with some brand-new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
