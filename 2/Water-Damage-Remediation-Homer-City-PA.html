The psychrometric chart provides us with the tools to examine which drying equipment or approaches will be the most efficient. It is necessary to identify if conditions are achievable within the drying chamber based on the outdoors temperature and particular humidity for a refrigerant or desiccant dehumidifier, or a heating unit. These conditions can assist in determining what devices to utilize on any loss.
