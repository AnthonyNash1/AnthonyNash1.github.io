They fasted to get to your house and started drying out our drenched crawlspace right away. They came back every day (typically two times a day) to keep track of and adjust the fans and dehumidifiers to take full advantage of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They described everything they were doing along the way and also were very helpful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster.

<p>They called me early morning and asked me for aid.

We also installed portable heating fans to accelerate the drying procedure.</p>
