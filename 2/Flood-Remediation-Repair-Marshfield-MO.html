It is your responsibility to pay the deductible if you make a claim with your carrier. It is customary for restoration contractors to gather the deductible up front when work is to begin, and we will inform your insurance company in such circumstances. Other times, your deductible might be subtracted" from the final insurance coverage check, in which case you would pay the deductible amount at the end of the task. Another possibility is that your insurance provider take the deductible quantity off of the quantity they owe you for your individual contents. In all these cases, you ultimately pay your deductible, either to Flagship or in another way.</p>

<p>When standing water is gotten rid of, the objective or our drying devices is to a) increase the rate of evaporation in areas where water has soaked up (this will briefly increase the humidity in the affected rooms) and b) eliminate the moisture in the air with effective dehumidifiers. There may be times when the rate of evaporation is a little out of balance with the rate of dehumidification, or vice versa. Part of our tracking procedure consists of checking ambient conditions both inside your home and out, and if we can take advantage of low humidity outdoors, we may choose to open a window or door to briefly purge" the damp air. BUT the rate of evaporation is greatly dependent on temperature as well, so cooling a space down with outdoor air can also set a drying project back days. We ask that you please inquire with our service professionals before you make any modifications if you have concerns on this.</p>
<p>BRAVO - task well done! Discovered a flood at home in San Francisco - water had been over streaming a second floor sink for 15 hours. Contacted Allied, signed work order on line and employees were at your house within 15 minutes. They brought a truck load of devices to reduce the damage. Drying fans were installed, heating pads were placed on hardwood ceilings, walls and floors were opened and drying and dehumidifying tubes installed. Exceptional, expert care. Very pleased with their swift shipment of emergency service AND their attention to detail to guarantee the water damage was dried out entirely.</p>
