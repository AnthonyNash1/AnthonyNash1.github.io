<p>Water intrusion into structures can be incredibly harmful. Jake and his guys were remarkable in assisting us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to the house and began drying out our drenched crawlspace immediately. They came back every day (often twice a day) to keep an eye on and adjust the dehumidifiers and fans to optimize the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists. They explained everything they were doing along the way and likewise were extremely useful in collaborating efforts with the insurance adjuster. They were more than fair on the costs and I 'd recommend them without doubt.</p>
<p>Because the gypsum drywall is soluble and permeable in water, getting it wet can turn into a major headache. Wet drywall will absorb water and grow heavy to manage from screw or nails that hold it in place. In the event where drywall does get damp and just begins to sag before drying out, fixing it may simply need pushing it back into place, protecting it with some new screws, and after that painting over it with some stain-killing paint.</p>
