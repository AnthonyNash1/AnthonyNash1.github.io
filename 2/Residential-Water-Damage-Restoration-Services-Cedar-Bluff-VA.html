As discussed, rapid air movement throughout damp surface areas of assemblies or materials is a vital part of efficiently and efficiently drying the surface area of those materials and assemblies. Conditions favorable to drying at the surface area differ from moving excess moisture within the assemblies or materials. Fast air movement throughout the surface of product ends up being less important relative to vapor pressure as the focus of removing surface wetness paves the way to lowering moisture content in low evaporation products. The continuous and falling rates of drying products require various criteria for changing conditions.</p>

We also set up portable heating fans to speed up the drying process.</p>

Research studies have actually revealed that ozone, even at high concentrations, is not effective at killing airborne mold or surface mold contamination.
