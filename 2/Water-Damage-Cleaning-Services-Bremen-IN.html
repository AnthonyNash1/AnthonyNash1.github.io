<h3>Tips To Restoration And Clean-Up After Smoke And Fire Damage in Bremen</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that drywall comes with a bound edge and a butt edge The bound or long edge is thinner than the rest of the sheet when you are planning big repair work. By minimizing the density here, it's easier to conceal long taped seams under several coats of joint substance. The butt edges at either end of the sheet are as thick as the rest of the sheet. In order to get an even, ended up look, it is very important to prevent joining bound edges to butt edges. Also keep in mind that because wall studs are vertical, drywall is usually connected so that the longer side runs horizontal (perpendicular) to the studs.
