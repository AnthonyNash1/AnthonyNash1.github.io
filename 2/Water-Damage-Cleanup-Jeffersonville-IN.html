<p>Any building that has actually suffered from water damage or problems with excess moisture is at danger of mold development. Wear a facemask or a respirator rated for black mold spore protection, and cover legs, arms and hands to prevent contact with mold spores. Use soap and a sponge to eliminate visible mold. If the moldy area is dry, lightly spray with water, as this will minimize the occurrence of airborne mold spores throughout cleaning. Next, utilize industrial black mold removal products, which can be found in most hardware or home repair stores, to disinfect the musty locations, in addition to any surrounding areas. Make sure it will not blemish the product or surface area if you utilize bleach. Place all sponges, equipment and other products used in cleaning in a heavy duty garbage bag, and if possible, remove the bag through a close-by exit instead of the main home, to avoid distributing mold spores.</p>
