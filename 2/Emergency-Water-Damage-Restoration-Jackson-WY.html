There is no reputable schedule for this procedure to happen; a MacBook's internal parts generally start rusting immediately after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can operate generally for days or weeks without revealing any obvious sign of a problem. How fast the corrosion procedure takes depends upon a lots of elements we have no control over, like humidity, the seriousness of the spill, and how long the device remained in contact with the liquid.
