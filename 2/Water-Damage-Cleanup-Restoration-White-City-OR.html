We focus on cleaning and fixing homes that have actually suffered fire damage and work toward safeguarding and securing your residential or commercial property from further damage.

As a locally owned and run business, SERVPRO of Platte County is nearby and ready to respond to storm and disaster events. We are happy to be an active member of the Kansas City neighborhood and wish to do our part to make our neighborhood the very best it can be. Always make certain you use an independent, 3rd party screening agency, and that if you use a mold remediation company, that they utilize a 3rd party screening firm themselves. Evaluating agencies must not provide any details on how to handle the issue, or charge you for remediation; they must just evaluate the mold and tell you what it is.<p>
<p>You wish to attend to restroom flooding as quickly as you can. Standing water soaks subflooring, wicks into sheetrock and creates a perfect breeding environment for unhealthy mold and mildew. These 10 actions get you on the road to flooded restroom recovery. Take a nylon bristle brush and scrub the area to lift and unsettle the dampened mold. Move the brush in careful strong strokes so you aren't splashing the mold on the surrounding locations-- even dead mold spores can be an allergenic health issue. After scrubbing thoroughly with the brush, clean the location clean with old rags or paper towels.<p>
<p>Start from the within out. Direct to the attic and look for any cracks of light. Where the sun is glancing through, there might be water leaking in. If you see water damage, don't wait to call a professional. Left untreated, leakages can cause structural problems, however they can be repaired and prevented if you capture it in time. With that in mind, here are 7 suggestions to help you identify and pick a water damage restoration service you can rely on.<p>
