<p>For the victims captured up in or affected by a fire, whether in the house or work, it can be one of the most frightening and traumatizing experiences. Mold spores are like tiny seeds, floating through the air till they land somewhere. Think about planting seeds in the ground. If the conditions are right, with moisture and nutrients, then the seed will sprout and grow. Mold works the very same way, so if the location the spores land is moist and excellent, mold can start to grow, spread out, and make more mold spores. All it needs is time, and you can have a big problem on your hands.</p>
