<p>Use a cloth or paper towel to dab your phone dry. Do not rub the phone dry, due to the fact that it could inadvertently push liquid into the phone's more sensitive parts. If the phone was entirely immersed, you may try vacuuming around the phone's fractures and openings to draw more water out. As soon as the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Correct cleanup after mold removal is essential to avoid recontamination. You need to seal and immediately get rid of materials that might have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse the shoes or boots you wore while cleaning, wash your clothes in hot water, and shower to remove spores that may have be on your hair or skin.<p>
