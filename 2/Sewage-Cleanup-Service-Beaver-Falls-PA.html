If you need custom-sized panels for an irregularly shaped repair, utilize your measurements to cut a patch to fit, utilizing an utility knife or drywall saw. Align your brand-new panel with the wall studs and after that protect the panel to the studs with drywall screws and a power driver. Use joint tape to cover the joints where each panel meets. Then apply joint compound over the tape, utilizing a putty knife. Let the substance dry for the time specified by the maker and after that sand the compound with fine-grit sandpaper up until the seams are flush with the drywall panels.</p>
