This is because of the metals oxidizing and slowly corroding. If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will interact with the liquid and accelerate this rust procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate across the board. You will likely end up with an extremely costly paperweight if this rust process is not stopped.</p>
