<p>Now that you are prepared for the mold cleaning or black mold removal, we can begin the cleaning procedure. Initially, look for the signs of mold. Check the moldy walls and open these up by utilizing a screwdriver. Do not be reluctant to cut through the drywall since you will be changing this anyway, or an expert will do the changing for you. Make sure that you get to the root cause of the molds and you should open the walls to find them. Scrub the surfaces with a mold cleaner and do this completely.
