Did you understand that smoke is really made from small particles of the fire itself? It's a harmful, hot substance that can damage the surfaces it touches, simply as fire does.

And the longer a fire is enabled to exist, the more substantial the smoke damage will be. The best smoke damage restoration techniques will include searching a broad area to clean up and repair smoke damage.</p>
