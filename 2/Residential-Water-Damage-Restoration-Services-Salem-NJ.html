<p>Since common building materials can sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is typically associated with water or wetness exposure and may be brought on by incomplete drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofs, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to thrive. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, usually condensing during the winter season in climates with a long heating season. Floors over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone.
