If there is a source of power available, such as a battery, which is providing power to the system (even if the computer system is off), the electric current will connect with the liquid and accelerate this deterioration procedure. This triggers the copper and other metals to migrate throughout the board. If this deterioration process is not stopped, you will likely end up with a really pricey paperweight.</p>
