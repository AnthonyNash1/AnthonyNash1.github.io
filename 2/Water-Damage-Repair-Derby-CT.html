<p>Mold in the basement can be persistent, offered the nature of basements - they tend to be a lot more damp than above-ground levels and generally have bad ventilation and little air circulation, a mix that can cause mold to thrive. And naturally, basements can be vulnerable to flooding, due to severe weather condition or unnoticed leakages in the pipelines or sump pump. In addition, when mold develops, concrete block or concrete walls can be difficult to clean due to their rough texture.</p>
