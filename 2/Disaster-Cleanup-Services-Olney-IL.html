<p>As moisture is released in the air, nature constantly tries to reach stability. Calculating the humidity is very important in drying because when air reaches saturation, water vapor will condense as dew on surface areas.

<p>Air Cleaning: Immediately we gear up the home with air scrubbers. We often will set one system for every two to three spaces, depending on the size of the space. These systems have an intake and outtake. The existing air is drawn through the consumption where it passes through three filters, one of which is a HEPA filter. These filters are evaluated and licensed to 99.99% HEPA effectiveness, which suggests that they get rid of a minimum of 99.99% of particles as little 0.3 microns in size. The air that is released through the outtake has actually been cleaned up and much of the smell eliminated. This procedure goes on for days. As you can imagine, over the course of a number of days, the air that is available in through the consumption is cleaner and cleaner with less odor so, with time and effective air scrubbing, we begin the air cleaning and deodorizing treatments.</p>
