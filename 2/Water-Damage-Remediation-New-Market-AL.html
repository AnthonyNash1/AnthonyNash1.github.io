<p>Tape over the joints with either mesh tape or paper tape. Though mesh tape appears to be easier due to the fact that it is self-adhesive, lots of expert drywall installers prefer paper tape. While I'm not an expert, I choose paper tape, too. However, paper tape isn't always practical. Using paper tape needs some practice and little skill, however it's well worth finding out. As soon as the meters read moisture levels equal to the previous dry state of the room, the specialist will eliminate the fans and dehumidifiers from the area. At this moment, the water remediation process is considered to finish.<p>
