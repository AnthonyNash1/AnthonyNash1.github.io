<p>Many molds are black but are not Stachybotrys. For example, the black mold typically found between restroom tiles is not Stachybotrys. Stachybotrys can be determined just by specifically trained experts through a tiny exam or by cultures. The Florida Department of Health does not suggest that individuals sample mold development in their home. All indoor mold growth should be removed, regardless of type.<p>
<p>Cleaning with bleach and water, or other home disinfectants will not kill mold. Try to keep yourself, children, workers and others out of the affected location. Attempting to dry the location with a fan may disrupt the spores and spread them to a new location. Removing black mold is a step-by-step process that requires persistence, an investment in protective gear and black mold removal products, and, of course, the nerve to brave dark, cramped areas occupied by hazardous fungus.<p>
