<p>When left alone, mold can cause severe health issues through airborne pathogens. What you may not know is that most chemicals, including bleach, have been proven inefficient versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to common belief, when you use bleach to eliminate mold on a porous surface area, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, etc.) it in fact helps with mold growth. The chlorine particles remain on the surface and will just kill a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mainly water) sinks into the product, promoting mold development.</p>
