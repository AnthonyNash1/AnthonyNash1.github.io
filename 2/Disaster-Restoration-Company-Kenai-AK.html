<p>When left alone, mold can cause major health issues through air-borne pathogens. What you may not know is that a lot of chemicals, consisting of bleach, have actually been shown inadequate versus eliminating mold in the long run. Contrary to popular belief, when you use bleach to kill mold on a permeable surface, (i.e. wood, drywall, grout, carpet, and so on) it really helps with mold growth. The chlorine molecules stay on the surface area and will only eliminate a fraction of the mold while the water in bleach (bleach is mostly water) sinks into the material, promoting mold development.</p>
<p>Daily wetness readings need to be included in the drying record to include equipment, a/c, and air systems. Moisture content levels for damp structural products need to be taped in a moisture content spreadsheet to reveal the development of drying These recorded moisture material readings will reveal that the structure is back to an acceptable series of pre-loss condition. It is necessary to know that air records alone will not prove that a structure is dry. After 24 hours the psychrometric conditions will show if sufficient dehumidification is being utilized or if changes are needed.</p>
