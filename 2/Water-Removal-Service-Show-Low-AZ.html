<p>Current Review: We called them out to evaluate water damage in our kitchen area after we discovered our faucet was leaking. They were quick to react and had Alex, Pablo, and Ryan out the next day.  They established a makeshift kitchen area for us in our living room and transported away everything else.  We were really delighted that we didn't have to raise a finger.  When they came back the next organisation day to do demolition and the water damage tidy up, Eric, Mike, Josh, and Pablo were very expert and hardworking.  I couldn't believe they got so much carried out in one day!  Someone has actually come out every day to sign in and I feel confident in their knowledge and capabilities to do the job appropriately. I would recommend them in a heart beat.<p>
<p>If you're dealing with a smaller hole (approximately 6"), use a thin layer of joint compound around the hole. Position your spot into the hole. Using a putty knife, work the paper edge down into the substance. Feather the edges of the compound and enable it to dry. Sand gently with a fine-grit sandpaper and apply a 2nd layer of joint compound to complete the repair. As water and storm damage professionals, we have the experience and advanced training that enables us to restore your property quickly. We utilize scientific drying principles and offer validation and paperwork that your residential or commercial property is dry and the task is total.<p>
