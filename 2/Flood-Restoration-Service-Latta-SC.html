<p>It's a difficult situation when water floods your floors, soaks into your walls, and damages your furnishings. Since a carpet cleaner can only do so much, you need a water damage cleanup team that does it all. Desiccants (silica gel, clay, calcium oxide) take in moisture like a sponge. Place water-permeable packages of desiccants and damp items in airtight containers or in sealed locations, like closets.
