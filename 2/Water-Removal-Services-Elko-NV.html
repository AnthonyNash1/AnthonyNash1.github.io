It is the progressive and slow deterioration of products (generally metals) by chemical reaction within their environment, In this case the deterioration takes place when you integrate electrical energy, water, metal and oxygen, producing iron oxide (or what is more commonly known as rust). There is no dependable schedule for this process to happen; a MacBook's internal parts normally start corroding immediately after the spill, however in many cases your Mac can work typically for days or weeks without revealing any apparent indication of an issue.
