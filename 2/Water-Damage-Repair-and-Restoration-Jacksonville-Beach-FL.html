You may attempt vacuuming around the phone's openings and fractures to suck more water out if the phone was completely immersed. Once the mold is gone, the task isn't over yet. Appropriate cleanup after mold removal is important to avoid recontamination. You should seal and immediately dispose of materials that may have contact with mold, like your mask. Rinse off the boots or shoes you used while cleaning, wash your clothes in hot water, and shower to remove spores that might have be on your hair or skin.<p>
