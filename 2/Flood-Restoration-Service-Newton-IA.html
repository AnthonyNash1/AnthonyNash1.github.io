<p>Water intrusion into structures can be exceptionally devastating. Jake and his people were incredible in helping us survive flooding from Typhoon Florence. They fasted to get to the house and started drying our soaked crawlspace immediately. They returned every day (typically two times a day) to keep an eye on and change the fans and dehumidifiers to make the most of the drying of the crawlspace and floor joists.
