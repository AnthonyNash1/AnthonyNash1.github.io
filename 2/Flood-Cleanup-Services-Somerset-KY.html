<p>Mold can trigger major health issues through air-borne pathogens when left alone. Juice 3 to 5 lemons and put over affected area. Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then clean it away with a wet towel. Similar to a few of the above techniques, you can use a toothbrush to scrub at the issue zone if you feel like the towel isn't working well enough. For ideal cleaning, mix lemon juice with any dish or hand soap you have in your home plus a little water. The soap will add a little additional heft to the mold-removal procedure.</p>
