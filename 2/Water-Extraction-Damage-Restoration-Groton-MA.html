These conditions can help in determining what devices to use on any loss. Enthalpy and its subcomponents, practical and hidden energy, can be computed by use of the Enthalpy Evaporation Evaluation Formula (E ³). ⁴ This formula properly predicts the energy assessment of ambient air and its relationship to multiple structure products and how they respond to each one and offer the very best evaporation results. The higher the number, the faster materials will dry. Utilizing this formula, desiccants are more helpful if the outside grains per pound of wetness are lower.</p>
