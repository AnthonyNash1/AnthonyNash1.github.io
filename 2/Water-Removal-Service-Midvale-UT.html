<p>Because common building materials are capable of sustaining mold development and mold spores are ubiquitous, mold growth in an indoor environment is normally connected to water or moisture exposure and might be brought on by insufficient drying of floor covering materials (such as concrete). Flooding, leaking roofings, building-maintenance or indoor- plumbing issues can lead to interior mold development. Water vapor typically condenses on surface areas cooler than the moisture-laden air, allowing mold to grow. 8 This wetness vapor travels through walls and ceilings, generally condensing throughout the winter in environments with a long heating season. Floorings over crawl areas and basements, without vapor barriers or with dirt floors, are mold-prone. The" doormat test" discovers wetness from concrete pieces without a sub-slab vapor barrier. 9 Some materials, such as refined concrete, do not support mold growth.</p>
