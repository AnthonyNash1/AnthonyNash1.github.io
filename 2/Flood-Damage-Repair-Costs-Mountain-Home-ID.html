<p>Our very first task at a water damage website is to evaluate the damage. We identify the source of the issue if it's not immediately clear. Beginning the mitigation procedure rapidly is necessary. If the water, and it's resulting damage, is not dealt with in a timely way, the damage can continue to magnify.

Eliminating black mold is a step-by-step process that needs patience, an investment in protective equipment and black mold removal products, and, naturally, the courage to brave dark, confined areas occupied by hazardous fungus.<p>
