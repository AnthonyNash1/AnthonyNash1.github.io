<p>When left alone, mold can trigger severe health concerns through air-borne pathogens. An automatic shut-off valve is excellent insurance to have in any circumstance, specifically when the water heater unit lies inside the home. Damage from water dripping out of your water heater impends unless fixed quickly, and the costs go up the longer the problem goes uncorrected. The culprit might have been something as easy as a pressure relief valve requiring replacing or something devastating like a tank failure.</p>
<p>Step 5: Restoration - The greatest action in the process is restoration. Restoration includes changing materials like drywall and insulation. Sometimes this procedure is as basic as installing a couple of panels of drywall, while severe cases could need changing entire walls. Exposure to poisonous compounds like lead and asbestos is possible throughout restoration. Older homes are most likely to include these substances.</p>
